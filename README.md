This is a prototype visual search interface that explores content from the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la). It is designed to provide an 'at-a-glance' visual overview of search results that allows a user to quickly assess whether or not their search was a success, and an intuitive means of narrowing the scope of the search. 

Built and tested with Google Chrome, may or may not work in other browsers.

See it online [here](http://www.schuyberg.com/dplaviz).

Known issues and next steps:
- Fix limiting by 'physical objects' and 'moving images'
- Improve date limiting (use mean date instead of begin date to calculate range?)
- Add sort by
- Add routing
- Improve subject facet legibility
